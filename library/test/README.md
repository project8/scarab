# Scarab Test

## Doxygen Documentation Testing

A Doxygen configuration file has been included in the `test` directory to allow testing of Doxygen documentation generation.

To use:

1. Enter into the `library/test` source directory
1. Run `doxygen Doxyfile`
1. Open `library/test/user_doxygen_out/html/index.html` in a web browser
1. When finished, remember to delete `library/test/user_doxygen_out` so that it doesn't get committed to the repo
